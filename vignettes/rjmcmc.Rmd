## Introduction

Global gene expression patterns are established and maintained by the 
concerted actions of Transcription Factors (TFs) and the proteins that 
constitute chromatin. The key structural element of chromatin is the 
nucleosome, which consists of an octameric histone core wrapped by 146 bps 
of DNA and connected to its neighbor by approximately 10-80 pbs of linker 
DNA (reference TODO).
