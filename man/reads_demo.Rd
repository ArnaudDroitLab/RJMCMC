\title{Forward reads and reverse reads in \code{numeric} format (for demo purpose).}
\format{A \code{list} containing:
\itemize{
    \item \code{readsFoward} a \code{vector} of non-negative \code{numeric},
    the start positions of the forward reads.
    \item \code{readsReverse} a \code{vector} of non-negative
    \code{numeric}, the start
    positions of the reverse reads. Beware that the start position of
    a reverse read is always higher that the end positition.

\usage{
data(reads_demo)
}
\description{
A group of froward and reverse reads that can be used to test the
\code{RJMCMC} function.
}

## Loading dataset

## Nucleosome positioning

         startPosReverseReads = reads_demo$readsReverse,
         nbrIterations = 100, lambda = 3, kmax = 30,
